# IMessageWrappedPython

# About
 This project was inspired by Spotify wrapped and Apple Music replay, these platforms give users a recap of their listening history for the year so I aimed
 to craete an app that gives people a recap of their iMessage history in 2022.
 
 # How it Works
 If your iMessage account on your iPhone is linked to your Macbook, a sql database file is stored on your Macbook containing all your message history.
 The application executes simple queries on this local databse file to find some cool insights into your message for 2022. No data is ever collected/stored
 all SQL commands are executed locally and are READ only.
 
 # How to use
 You can downlad the source code and execute it from your own IDE. Currently working on packaging the program into a single executable file
